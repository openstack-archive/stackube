Welcome to Stackube documentation!
=============================================

Stackube is a Kubernetes-centric OpenStack distro. It uses Kubernetes, instead of Nova, as the compute
fabric controller, to provision containers as the compute instance, along with other OpenStack
services (e.g. Cinder, Neutron). It supports multiple container runtime technologies, e.g. Docker,
Hyper, and offers built-in soft / hard multi-tenancy (depending on the container runtime used).
