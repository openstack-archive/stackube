# Stackube

Stackube is a OpenStack-friendly Kubernetes distro. It allows you to run
a Kubernetes cluster with OpenStack components with both soft and hard
multi-tenancy. It aligns with the OpenStack mission:

* Built on Kubernetes and existing OpenStack services, such as Neutron,
  Keystone, Cinder, and potentially more.
* Run on baremetal.
* Support multiple container runtimes (Docker, Hyper) and provide
  built-in soft and hard multi-tenancy hypervisor-based container runtime
  (e.g. [Hyper](https://hypercontainer.io)) is configured.

Stackube uses the Apache v2.0 license. All library dependencies allow for
unrestricted distribution and deployment.
